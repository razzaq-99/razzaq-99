## Hi 👋

🚀 Exploring Agentic AI, GenAI, RAG & LLMs
I’m currently working at the intersection of Agentic AI and Generative AI, building intelligent, autonomous solutions using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Large Language Models (LLMs). As a Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA), I actively contribute to the tech community and have led multiple teams with strong leadership and collaboration skills.

💡 With a background in application development and over a year of hands-on experience, I’ve worked on various real-world projects and thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments. I'm a quick learner passionate about leveraging AI and modern tech to solve impactful problems.
